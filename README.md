This is the Tinkering Graphics project. We chose the First Contract: **Blended Pixellation**

----------

We adapted the pasterization algorithm to do pixelation and the greyscale algorithm to get average color of the area we want to pixelate,

We used collage algorithm for blending in all the pixelated areas, and we used alpha blending algorithm for blending the original and pixelated pictures together - inspired by pseudocode here: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/746937](https://stackoverflow.com/a/746937)

**The picture files used are in bin/Debug folder**

You can open the solution which is in the TinkeringGraphics_Pixelization folder
